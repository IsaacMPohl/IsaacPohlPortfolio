Hello, my name is Isaac Pohl and I am a Freshmen in college. During high school I attened Gibson Southern High School and Southern Indiana Career & Technical Center where I took the computer science class. I enjoy computer science because it is challenging and offers many opportunities to learn. I was also in advanced math which I believe is very important in developing the mindset of a successful person. Outside of class I am always looking for ways to learn and be involved in the community. During high school I was a member of Gibson Southern FFA, Vanderburgh County Junior Leaders, and SICTC BPA. For each of these clubs, I have earned many awards at the local and state levels. I also participate in cross country and track & field at Gibson Southern. Currently, I am employed at Pohl's Ag Services which is a company that helps farmers analyze crops yields. In 2023, during the summer, I helped collect plant samples and created a database for a farmer. In 2023, I was one of twelve students who was picked in the United States to be part of the National Precision Agriculture Team. This required me to teach a drone program to youth in Southern Indiana. I have educated approximently 200 youth on the importance of drone usage in agriculture. Another outstanding accomplishment which I have has been owning a greenhouse. I was awarded an FFA Professional Award and a $1,000 grant from Bob Evan's to expand my greenhouse business.

# Jobs
## Pohl's Ag Services (2020-present)
I was in charge doing 2023 summer to collect leaf samples for various farmers. After collecting 12 weeks of data for each corn and soybean field, I was in charge of creating a database for father anylsasis of how nutrients results to yields specially with certain nutrient and chemical trails. For this database I decided to use Micrsoft Access which was a introduction level of software that allowed me to clean and devleope basic sql commands. This worked well esspecially with graphs. This database was used the next season of 2024 whenever I went to collect leaf samples again. Click here to see graphs and simple data. For this I also had to clearn the proper stages of corn and soybeans to record in database correctly. Click on the cards below to learn more.

## Parrish Consulting Services (Juanary 2024-present)
I started this internship in Juanuray 2024, during this interneship I had to learn Micrsoft Blazor and learn the C# language. During this August 2024

## Pohl's Greenhouse
I started in 2020 a small hobby greenhouse where I grew plants for my family. Over the years, I expanded my company. I learned some of the most important life lessons while working on this business. In 2022, I grew and sold $700 worth of plants, this year I sold $900 worth of plants. Below is my SAE proficiency award application which I received 1st placed at the State FFA Convention.

## Pohl's Farms(2019-2023)
This was my very first job. My brother also worked for the farmer (Steve Pohl) in years past. Steve is related to my family (my Dad's Cousin). I was very determined to prove myself by showing up to work on time and working my hardest. This job was tough and included cleaning grain bins out, taking down buildings, feeding hogs, shoveling gravel, moving water containers, farming and many other duties. This job was very stressful. I was 15 years old and harvesting the fields with a John Deere Combine. The days required long hours and I couldn't stop to think about what to do because as Steve reminded me countless times each minute wastes hundreds of dollars. Along with harvesting, I operated the grain cart and cultivator.

## Kuester Landscaping(2019-2020)
These are the years in which I worked for a landscaping company. This company was small but required hard work and dedication especially on hot days. My tasks included push mowing, trimming bushes, picking weeds, and helping decide on landscaping needs for the customer. One important thing which I learned from this company is that as a business owner you need to put customers first.

## Pohl's Pumpkin
This is also my other business which I started in 2015. At first I grew pumpkins on a 1/4 acre plot in my parents' garden. In 2020, I decided to partner up with my cousin, this allowed us to grow pumpkins on a 1 acre plot at his house. We quickly opened up a website and facebook page for advertisement. In 2023 we decided to stop growing pumpkins since my cousin Ezra was going to college.
