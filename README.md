Hello, my name is Isaac Pohl and I am a junior in high school. I attend Gibson Southern High School and Southern Indiana Career & Technical Center where I take the computer science class. I enjoy computer science because it is challenging and offers many opportunities to learn. I am also in advanced math which I believe is very important in developing the mindset of a successful person. Outside of class I am always looking for ways to learn and be involved in the community. I am a member of Gibson Southern FFA, Vanderburgh County Junior Leaders, and SICTC BPA. For each of these clubs, I have earned many awards at the local and state levels. I also participate in cross country and track & field at Gibson Southern. Currently, I am employed at Pohl's Ag Services which is a company that helps farmers analyze crops yields. In 2023, during the summer, I am going to collect plant samples and create a database for farmers. In 2023, I was one of twelve students who was picked in the United States to be part of the National Precision Agriculture Team. This required me to teach a drone program to youth in Southern Indiana. I have educated approximently 200 youth on the importance of drone usage in agriculture. Another outstanding accomplishment which I have has been owning a greenhouse. I was awarded an FFA Professional Award and a $1,000 grant from Bob Evan's to expand my greenhouse business.

# Goals
I plan to attend college to earn a bachelor's degree in computer science at IUPUI, SIU, or Purdue University. After college my goal is to obtain a computer science job working either remotely or locally and live in the Tristate area. After college, I would like to continue to sell plants from my greenhouse located in Haubstadt. Someday, I would like to marry and have children. My goal would be to have enough money saved to go on more vacations later in my life and to help pay for my kids' college educations.

# Jobs
Pohl's Ag Services (2020-present)
I worked for Pohl's Ag Services starting in 2020 which was covid year. I was excited when I started because my brother worked at this company for many years. At first I worked alongside my boss to soil sample fields, fixing farmers maps for more accurate data analysis, repairing equipment, helping analyze farmers fields, installing irrigation sensors, and installing weather stations. This past winter, I helped build a new building for the business. This summer I will have much more independence and will be assigned to go to different fields to do many of these same tasks along with a new project which I will be in charge of. This involves collecting leaf samples of corn for farmers and analyzing the data. I love working for this company and I will be a great help to this company to grow in the digital world in the future.

## Pohl's Greenhouse
I started in 2020 a small hobby greenhouse where I grew plants for my family. Over the years, I expanded my company. I learned some of the most important life lessons while working on this business. In 2022, I grew and sold $700 worth of plants, this year I sold $900 worth of plants. Below is my SAE proficiency award application which I received 1st placed at the State FFA Convention.

## Pohl's Farms(2019-present)
This was my very first job. My brother also worked for the farmer (Steve Pohl) in years past. Steve is related to my family (my Dad's Cousin). I was very determined to prove myself by showing up to work on time and working my hardest. This job was tough and included cleaning grain bins out, taking down buildings, feeding hogs, shoveling gravel, moving water containers, farming and many other duties. This job was very stressful. I was 15 years old and harvesting the fields with a John Deere Combine. The days required long hours and I couldn't stop to think about what to do because as Steve reminded me countless times each minute wastes hundreds of dollars. Along with harvesting, I operated the grain cart and cultivator.

## Kuester Landscaping(2019-2020)
These are the years in which I worked for a landscaping company. This company was small but required hard work and dedication especially on hot days. My tasks included push mowing, trimming bushes, picking weeds, and helping decide on landscaping needs for the customer. One important thing which I learned from this company is that as a business owner you need to put customers first.

## Pohl's Pumpkin
This is also my other business which I started in 2015. At first I grew pumpkins on a 1/4 acre plot in my parents' garden. In 2020, I decided to partner up with my cousin, this allowed us to grow pumpkins on a 1 acre plot at his house. We quickly opened up a website and facebook page for advertisement. In 2023 we decided to stop growing pumpkins since my cousin Ezra was going to college.
